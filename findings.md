# Findings log

Learned rules, agent-facing and terse. Started fresh 2026-09-18 when the
previous optimisation work was archived; the old log is in
`archive/2026-08-tuning/findings.md` and its conclusions do not carry over,
because the new project starts from a known recipe on a fixed build.

Format: one entry per finding, with these fields on the heading line or
immediately under it.

- date: when it was learned.
- status: active, superseded, or graduated.
- scope: which test, rung, build or campaign it holds for. Never "everything"
  unless that has been shown.
- evidence: the run identities or study it rests on.
- supersedes: the finding it replaces, if any.

A finding graduates into a requirement, a procedure, an extraction test or a
config default. Its status then changes to graduated and it stays, with a
pointer to where it landed. Nothing is deleted. There is no cap on how many
findings exist; the cap is on how many are loaded at once.
